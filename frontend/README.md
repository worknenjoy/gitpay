## Configuring the `package.json` to run

Alter the `scripts` to execute dev and production as below:
  ```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server --progress --colors --inline --hot",
    "production": "webpack --progress -p"
  }
  ```
### Execute Server Client

`npm5 run dev` or `npm5 run production`

## Create structure of folder

- Was create folder `public` and `src` in the root of project
- Inside the `public` folder the file `index.html` where it will be `<! DOCTYPE html>` and pointing the `id` of our react app:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
          <title>GitPay</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">	
      </head>
	<body>
		<div id="app">
			<script src="app.js"></script>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>

- Was include the tag `<scriptsrc="app.js"></script>` it is file generated by webpack
- In the `src` folder you will create the name of the `main` folder where the `src/main/app.js` and `src/main/app.css` file were created. The `src/main/app.js` is the main component that will be imported into `src/index.js`
- Created folder `src/common`, `src/common/form` and `src/common/operator` to component dynamic

### Folder `src/common/form`

- Was create the file `inputAuth.js` due the particularities

### Folder `src/common/operator`

- Created the file `if.js` what it is a operator

### Installation of the library Redux

- To create the Component Auth will need redux library to control of state dynamic

> `redux@3.7.1`, `react-redux@5.0.5`, `redux-promise@0.5.3`, `redux-form@6.4.1`, `react-redux-toastr@4.4.2`, `redux-thunk@2.1.0` and `redux-multi@0.1.12`

### Configuring redux library

- Created the file to communication of Redux `src/main/reducers`

### Configuring routes

- Created the file `src/main/routes.js` to navigation App

### Import the library Redux to the project inside of `src/index.js`

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

import promise from 'redux-promise'
import multi from 'redux-multi'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

import Routes from './main/routes'
import reducers from './main/reducers'

const store = applyMiddleware(multi, thunk, promise)(createStore)(reducers)
ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <Routes />
    </Provider>
, document.getElementById('app'))
```

### Created the file `src/main/authOrApp`

- Created to validation **Auth** or **App**

### Created folder `src/auth`
