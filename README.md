Freelancing with development workflow

## What is this about?

To offer a marketplace for developers, digital products and platforms that use GIT for on demand project needs.

* You can complete tasks with open collaboration and receive bounties for it
* companies can receive reports, fixes and enhancements about the project by developers and offer bounties to complete required tasks


## Requirements

* Node.js (currently at v8.6.0)
* React with webpack


## Running tests

To run the test: 
`npm run migrate` (first time)

`npm run test` (to run the tests)

## Env to do some actions

For fully integration with api services used by the platform, you will need the api keys. *You should make a copy of your `.env.example` to `.env`* with the right credentials. Please let me know if you need any of those to solve a issue (mail tarefas@gitpay.me)


## Run migration

To run the migrations

`npm run migrate`

For user as example
