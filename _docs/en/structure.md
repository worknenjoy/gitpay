Git is a distributed version control system that changes the way we think about software development. It evolved from other systems such as SVN and today it is hard to imagine scaling a project using the traditional FTP approach.

Having version control is indispensable to track project versions and allows teams to resolve conflicts and work together without major issues.

Using this workflow has a positive impact on the entire business. With Gitpay payments are part of the process so the company becomes more independent and flexible to address project needs and invest on demand.

## Git for developers

Developers benefit the most from using Git and hosting their projects on platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket.

Developer communities don't need to discuss hiring models or workflows because they share common tools and processes.

That makes Gitpay a better option for developers than working on projects without an agile mindset.

Developers familiar with Git are comfortable working in distributed teams.

### Continuous releases of new versions

Since different developers work independently in their own repositories, distributed development becomes efficient and a community can collaborate without conflicts, enabling a faster delivery cycle.

Development projects encourage small but frequent changes to be integrated quickly. Once a change is sent, a cycle starts to run all the steps necessary to deploy the update.

Git works very well with continuous integration.
