One of the biggest advantages of Git Workflow is having tasks defined following a template. The template may vary and over time we discover what works best for us.

To create a task on Gitpay simply paste the link to an issue already created on GitHub, where you can define templates and contribution guidelines for teams.

For every task we usually address the following points:

## Why this task

What is the motivation for opening this task? What's the purpose?

## Level

It's good to know the required level to finish it: beginner, intermediate or advanced.

## Current behaviour

Describe clearly what's happening now so we can reproduce and understand the present state.

## Expected behaviour

How things should be after the changes. Describe the ideal scenario so it's clear how it differs from the current behaviour.

## Useful links

References that can serve as inspiration or help with some aspect of the task.

## How to reproduce

Explain how someone working on the task can reach the current behaviour that needs to be changed.
