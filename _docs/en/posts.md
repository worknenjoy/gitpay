## Paying for a task
When a task is created on Gitpay it can receive rewards.

Currently rewards can be paid with credit card or PayPal.

It is also possible to create more than one order and combine both methods.

When you get paid you will receive the amount according to the payment method used.

> When you see the value of a task on Gitpay the payment has already been pre-authorized.

If the task was paid by credit card the amount will be deposited in your registered account.

If it was paid through PayPal the payment will be sent to your PayPal account.

You need to configure your payment options at [https://gitpay.me/#/profile/payment-options](https://gitpay.me/#/profile/payment-options).

> To know which payment method was used for a task check the orders page.

Orders are the payments that are released to your active account when the task is completed.
