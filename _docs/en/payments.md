When a task is completed and the related issue and pull request are closed, the code is deployed to production and you receive the bounty payment.

Below we explain how this works:

## Investing in an issue as a bounty
An issue imported to Gitpay available in our platform can have a bounty added as a payment for the ones interested in their resolution. Maybe it is a client, or who keeps the project or a set of sponsors that together will support to solve something for a third party, in a model known as *crowdfunding*

When someone funds a task the money is held on our platform. You can apply to solve that task. To receive the payment you must activate your account and provide your bank details for a transfer.

> A bounty means someone paid to evaluate your solution and approve the reward.

## Payments with credit card: receive directly in your bank account
When a task paid by credit card is solved, a new order is created and the payment is sent once the code is merged.

For this kind of payment you must have an active bank account configured on the platform. Once activated the transfer takes approximately *2 days*.

> Transfers incur an 8% fee in USD, according to Stripe terms.

## Payments with Paypal: receive payments to your Paypal account
For payments via PayPal you must activate your PayPal account. The amount will be adjusted according to PayPal fees.

> If you prefer PayPal, make sure the task was funded using PayPal.


## Payments done with Credit Card and Paypal
If a task has multiple orders with different payment methods you will need both a bank account and a PayPal account active to receive the full amount.
